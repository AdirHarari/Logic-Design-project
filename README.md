# Logic-Design-project

In the second year, I had a course called "Advanced Digital Design-VHDL."
In this course, the final project was to build a Control and Command System for a small autonomous car connected to an FPGA. The vehicle can travel different routes, illuminate different shapes, make different sounds, and rotate a fan attached to its roof.
I was part of team A and wrote the code for our part of the project alone.
